.. _Developing Your Course Outline:

###################################
Developing Your Course Outline
###################################

As you develop your course, you work primarily in the edX Studio course
outline.  See the following information about working with the course outline:

* `Open the Course Outline`_
* `Example of a Developed Course in the Outline`_
* `Viewing the Course Organization as a Student`_
* `Navigating the Course Outline`_
* `Add Content in the Course Outline`_
* `Reorganize the Course Outline`_
* `Delete Content in the Course Outline`_
* `The Course Outline User Interface`_
  
See the following chapters for information on working with different content
levels in the outline:

* :ref:`Developing Course Sections`
* :ref:`Developing Course Subsections`
* :ref:`Developing Course Units`
* :ref:`Developing Course Components`

****************************
Open the Course Outline
****************************

To view the course outline:

#. Log in to edX Studio.
#. From the **Content** menu, select **Outline**.
   
The first time you view an outline for a course, it contains no content. 

.. image:: ../Images/outline_empty.png
 :alt: An empty course outline

You must :ref:`create the first section<Create a Section>`.
  
********************************************************
Example of a Developed Course in the Outline
********************************************************

The following example shows a sample course in the outline, with indications
for sections, subsections, and units. As you develop your course, it will begin
to look like this example:

.. image:: ../Images/outline-callouts.png
 :alt: An empty course outline

As this example shows, the course is organized at the following levels:

* :ref:`Sections<Developing Course Sections>`, which contain:
* :ref:`Subsections<Developing Course Subsections>`, which contain:
* :ref:`Units<Developing Course Units>`, which contain:
* :ref:`Components<Developing Course Components>`, which are not shown in the
  outline.
  
Use the links above for more information and instructions on working with each
type of object in the course. The rest of this chapter describes the course
organization in the outline.

********************************************************
Viewing the Course Organization as a Student
********************************************************

The content you see in the outline in Studio is displayed to students in the
Courseware tab in the LMS. The following image shows how a student sees your
course content:

.. _Navigating the Course Outline:

*******************************
Navigating the Course Outline
*******************************

You navigate the course outline by expanding and collapsing sections and
subsections.  Use the triangle icon next to a section or subsection name to
expand or collapse its contents:

.. image:: ../Images/outline-expand-collapse.png
 :alt: The outline with expand and collapse icons circled

When you expand a subsection, all units in the subsection are visible:

.. image:: ../Images/outline-with-units.png
 :alt: The outline with an expanded subsection

Click the name of a unit to open the :ref:`unit page<Developing Course Units>`.

.. _Add Content in the Course Outline:

************************************************
Add Content in the Course Outline
************************************************

You add sections, subsections, and units directly in the outline.

To add a section to the end of the outline, click **New Section** at the top of
the outline page or at the bottom of the outline:

.. image:: ../Images/outline-create-section.png
 :alt: The outline with the New Section buttons circled

To add a subsection to the end of the section, expand a section and click **New
Subsection**:

.. image:: ../Images/outline-new-subsection.png
 :alt: The outline with the New Subsection button circled

To add a unit to the end of a subsection, expand the subsection and click **New
Unit**:

.. image:: ../Images/outline-new-unit.png
 :alt: The outline with the New Subsection button circled

The :ref:`unit<Developing Course Units>` page opens.

.. _Reorganize the Course Outline:

************************************************
Reorganize the Course Outline
************************************************

You can reorganize your course content by dragging and dropping sections,
subsections and units to new locations in the outline.

If you wan to move a subsection to a different section, or a unit to a
different subsection, first make make sure the target location is expanded.

To move an section, subsection, or unit, hover over the handle on the right of
the object's box until the mouse pointer changes to a four-headed arrow:

Then, click and drag the object to the location that you want. When you move an
object, a blue line indicates where the object will land when you release the
mouse button:

.. _Delete Content in the Course Outline:

************************************************
Delete Content in the Course Outline
************************************************

You delete sections, subsections, and units from the course outline.

.. warning::  
 You cannot restore course content after you delete it. To ensure you do not
 delete content you may need later, you can move any unused content to a
 section in your course that you set to never release.

Click the delete icon in the box for the object you want to delete:

.. image:: ../Images/outline-delete.png
 :alt: The outline with Delete icons circled

You are prompted to confirm the deletion.

.. note::
 When you delete an object, all contained objects are deleted. For example,
 when you delete a subsection, all units in that subsection are deleted.
