.. _Controlling Content Visibility:

###################################
Controlling Content Visibility
###################################

As course staff, you must carefully control which content is visible to
students and when.

You control content visibility through three features in Studio:

* `Release Dates`_
* `Unit Publishing Status`_
* `Content Hidden from Students`_
  
 All three features work together to control content visibility for students.

.. _Release Dates:

***********************
Release Dates
***********************

You schedule release dates for sections and subsections. Published units are
visible to students after those release dates.

Prior to the release date, content in the section or the subsection is not
visible to students. Such content is visible to course staff
:ref:`previewing the course <Preview Course Content>` or :ref:`viewing the live
course as staff<View Your Live Course>`.

By default, a subsection inherits the release date of the section it is in,
though you can change it.

See:

* :ref:`Set a Section Release Date`
* :ref:`Set a Subsection Release Date`


***********************
Unit Publishing Status
***********************

You publish units to make them visible to students.  Students see the last
published version of a unit if the section and subsection it is in are
released.

Students do not see units that have never been published, and they do not see
unpublished changes to units or components within units.

For more information, see :ref:`Unit Publishing Status`.

.. _Content Hidden from Students:

*****************************
Content Hidden from Students
*****************************

You can :ref:`hide any unit from students<Hide a Unit from Students>`,
regardless of the parent section and subsection's release dates.
