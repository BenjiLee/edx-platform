Getting Started with Course Content Development
###############################################

When you are done :ref:`setting up your course<Setting up your Course Index>`,
you are ready to build your course content.

This chapter provides an outline of the steps involved in developing your
course content, with links to more details. See:

* `Understanding Course Building Blocks`_
* `Creating New Course Content`_
* `Making Course Content Visible to Students`_
* `Revising Content`_

.. _Understanding Course Building Blocks:

************************************************
Step 1: Understanding Course Building Blocks
************************************************

Before you begin, you should understand the building blocks of an edX course.

* :ref:`The course outline<Developing Your Course Outline>` is the container
  for all of your course content. The outline contains one or more sections.
* :ref:`Course sections<Developing Course Sections>` are at the top level of
  your course and typically represent a time period. A section contains one or
  more subsections.
* :ref:`Course subsections<Developing Course Subsections>` are parts of a
  section, and usually represent a topic or other organizing principle. A
  subsection contains one or more units.
* :ref:`Course units <Developing Course Units>` are lessons in a subsection
  that students view as single pages. A unit contains one or more components.
* :ref:`Course components<Developing Course Components>` are objects within
  units that contain your actual course content.

.. _Creating New Course Content:

****************************************
Step 2: Creating New Course Content
****************************************

Once you understand the way edX courses are structured, you can start
organizing your content and entering it into Studio. As you build your outline
and enter your content into your course, you'll also schedule when different
parts of the course will be released.

For information, see the following tasks:

#. :ref:`Create a Section`
#. :ref:`Create a Subsection`
#. :ref:`Create a Unit`
#. :ref:`Add a Component`

.. _Making Course Content Visible to Students:

******************************************************
Step 3: Making Course Content Visible to Students
******************************************************

When you create your content, you'll also specify if and when students will be
able to see it. Content visibility depends on several factors: the release
dates of the section and subsection, the publishing status of the unit, and the
Hide content from students setting. For more information, see :ref:`Controlling
Content Visibility`.

Also see the following tasks:

* :ref:`Set a Section Release Date`
* :ref:`Set a Subsection Release Date`
* :ref:`Publish a Unit`


.. _Revising Content:

****************************
Step 4: Revising Content
****************************

You can revise your course content at any time. When you reorganize sections
and subsections, the new order is immediately visible to students. When you
change a unit, or components within a unit, you must publish those changes to
make them visible to students.
