.. _Developing Course Subsections:

###################################
Developing Course Subections
###################################

To develop subsections in your course, you must first understand the
following:

* `What is a Subsection?`_
* `Viewing Subsections in the Outline`_
* `The Student View of a Subsection`_
* `Subsections and Visibility to Students`_
* `Release Statuses of Subsections`_
* `Subsections and Grading`_
  
Subsection tasks:

* `Create a Subsection`_
* `Change a Subsection Name`_
* `Set the Assignment Type and Due Date for a Subsection`_
* `Set a Subsection Release Date`_
* `Reorganize Subsection`_
* `Delete a Subsection`_


****************************
What is a Subsection?
****************************

Sections are divided into subsections, which in turn contain one or more units.
A subsection may represent a topic in your course, or another organizing
principle. Subsections are sometimes called “lessons” or “learning sequences.”


***********************************
Viewing Subsections in the Outline
***********************************

The follow example shows three subsections in a section, all collapsed, in the
course outline:

.. image:: ../Images/subsections.png
 :alt: Three collapsed subsections in the outline


*********************************
The Student View of a Subsection
*********************************

Students see subsections in the Courseware tab, listed beneath the expanded
section. In the following example, six subsections are circled, and the first
is open.

************************************************
Subsections and Visibility to Students
************************************************

Students never see a subsection that has an unscheduled or future release date.

If the release date of both the subsection and the section it is in have
passed, students see published units in the subsection. 

However, students do not necessarily see all content in the subsection.

Students may not see content in a unit, if it was never published, or if it is
hidden from students.

************************************************
Release Statuses of Subsections
************************************************

As an course author, you control the release status of subsections.  For the
content of a subsection to be visible to students, the subsection must be
released. See the following for more information:

* `Scheduled with Section`_
* `Unscheduled`_
* `Scheduled Later than the Section`_
* `Scheduled with Unpublished Changes`_
* `Released with Unpublished Changes`_
* `Released`_

=======================
Scheduled with Section
=======================

When you create a subsection, it is set by default to release at the same time
as the section it is in. Therefore, published content in the subsection visible
to students at the date and time the section is released.

The following example shows how an subsection in the Scheduled with Section
state is displayed in the outline, with a red bar:

.. image:: ../Images/subsection-scheduled.png
 :alt: A subsection scheduled to release with the section


========================
Unscheduled
========================

If the containing section is unscheduled, when you create a new subsection it
will also be unscheduled.

Regardless of the publishing status of units within the subsection, no content
in an unscheduled subsection is visible to students.

The following example shows how an subsection in the Draft: Unscheduled state
is displayed in the outline, with a gray bar:

.. image:: ../Images/subsection-unscheduled.png
 :alt: An unscheduled subsection

Content is not visible to students until you set a release date and the date
passes.


===================================
Scheduled Later than the Section
===================================

You can set a subsection to release on a date after the section releases. 

Content in a subsection that is scheduled for release on a future date is not
visible to students, regardless of the published status of the units it
contains.

The following example shows how an subsection in the Scheduled state is
displayed in the outline:

.. image:: ../Images/subsection-scheduled-different.png
 :alt: A subsection scheduled to release later than the section

The scheduled date must pass for the subsection to be visible to students.

==================================
Scheduled with Unpublished Changes
==================================

You can make changes to a published unit before its containing subsection
releases. 

In this situation, when the release date for the subsection passes, the last
published version of units within the subsection are made visible to students.
The changes in units are not visible to students until you publish them.

The following example shows how a subsection in the Scheduled state with
unpublished changes is displayed in the outline, with a yellow bar:

.. image:: ../Images/section-scheduled-with-changes.png
 :alt: A scheduled subsection with unpublished changes


==================================
Released with Unpublished Changes
==================================

If you modify a unit within a released subsection, those modifications are not
visible to students until you publish them.

The following example shows how a subsection in the released state with
unpublished changes is displayed in the outline, with a yellow bar:

.. image:: ../Images/section-released-with-changes.png
 :alt: A released subsection with unpublished changes

===========================
Released
===========================

A subsection that is released is visible to students; however students see only
units within the subsection that are Published.

The following example shows how a subsection in the Released state is
displayed in the outline, with a blue bar:

.. image:: ../Images/subsection-released.png
 :alt: A released subsection

===========================
Staff Only Content
===========================

A subsection may contain a unit that is hidden from students and available to
staff only. That unit is not visible to students, regardless of the release
date of the subsection.

The following example shows how an subsection that contains a unit that is
hidden from students is displayed in the outline, with a black bar:


.. image:: ../Images/section-hidden-unit.png
 :alt: A section with a hidden unit 




.. _Subsections and Grading:

*************************
Subsections and Grading
*************************

You :ref:`set the assignment type for problems at the subsection level<Set the
Assignment Type and Due Date for a Subsection>`. This means that all problems
within the subsection are graded and weighted as a single type.  For example,
if you designate the assignment type for a subsection as **Homework**, then all
problem types in that subsection are graded as homework.

For more information, see :ref:`Establish a Grading Policy`.


.. _Create a Subsection:

****************************
Create a Subsection
****************************

To create a new subsection:

#. In the outline, expand the section in which you want to create a new
   subsection.
#. Click **New Subsection** at the bottom of the expanded section. A new
   subsection is added at the end of the section.
#. Click the Edit icon next to the new subsection name, then enter the name for
   the new subsection. Remember that students see the subsection name in the
   courseware.
#. :ref:`Add units<Create a Unit>` to the new subsection as needed.



********************************
Change a Subsection Name
********************************

To change a subsection name, click the Edit icon next to the subsection name.
The name field becomes writable. Enter the new name and tab out of the field to
save it.
